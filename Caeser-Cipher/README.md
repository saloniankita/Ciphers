The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. 

For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by C, B would become D, and so on.
So, if the plaintext is "HELLO", then after encryption, it would become "JGNNQ".
