Railfence Cipher is a transposition cipher that follows a simple rule for mixing up the characters in the plaintext to form the ciphertext. It jumbles up the order of the letters of a message in a quick convenient way but it also has the security of a key to make it a little bit harder to break.

The Rail Fence cipher works by writing a message on alternate lines across the page, and then reading off each line in turn. 
For example, the plaintext "defend the east wall" is written as "DFNTEATALEEDHESWL", with all spaces removed.
