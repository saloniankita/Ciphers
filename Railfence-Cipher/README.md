Railfence Cipher is a transposition cipher that follows a simple rule for mixing up the characters in the plaintext to form the ciphertext. It jumbles up the order of the letters of a message in a quick convenient way but it also has the security of a key to make it a little bit harder to break.

The Rail Fence cipher works by writing a message on alternate lines across the page, and then reading off each line in turn. 
For example, the plaintext "Hello World" is written as "Horel ollWd", with all spaces removed.
